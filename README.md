# LangChainProject
This is dynamic restaurant name generator using Langchain
Here I have used sequential chains,prompt templates to take input and provide us output in streamline way.
I have used "temperature" paramter to set the creativeness of the output the model generates.
I have used streamlit module to handle the frontend part of the project.
Make sure to use your own api keys as they are explicit to every user
